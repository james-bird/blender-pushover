# blender-pushover

A [Blender](https://www.blender.org) add-on to send [Pushover](https://pushover.net) notifications when renders are complete.

Sends either a text notification or the image too.

## Installation
Download and install add-on using .zip file in [releases](https://github.com/james-bird/blender-pushover/releases), which is just the zipped contents of the repository. Then add Pushover user name and token in Blender add-on preferences. The add-on behaviour is configured in the "Render Properties" tab of the UI.

## N.B.
Not extensively tested. Working but unfinished. Pull requests welcome.
